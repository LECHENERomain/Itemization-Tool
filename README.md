# Itemization tool

This tool is mainly designed to help you get better at itemization in League of Legends.
First, you can draft the 10 champions you need to have proper teamcomps, and you will be prompted to chose
the champion you want to itemize. You will then be able to select the items you want to build.

Eventually, I would like to add the option to show/add/destroy turrets on the map, and do the same with
neutral objectives. This would be a great way to show different gamestates, and how to approach them.
